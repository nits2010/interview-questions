[SHP.IV1.RV2] Chemistry [A]
Description
A molecule is composed of atoms. Each atom is represented by a single uppercase letter. We only consider C, H, and O for this problem. The weight of each element can be found below:

C = 12

H = 1

O = 8

 

We are interested in calculating the mass of the molecule. It does not matter if the specified formula is not a valid molecule, we just want to get the total weight. 

 

You need to write a function calculateWeight which takes in a single parameter: a string called formula. We can calculate the total weight by adding all the weights of each atom, multiplied by the appropriate multiplier. A number in the input string represents a multiplier and it is applied to the element preceding it. 

 

We also guarantee that all the numbers are single-digit and larger than 0. 

 

Examples

CH4

The output should be 16 as it is 12 (C is 12) and 4 times H (which is 1), so it is 12 + 4 = 16.

 

CHO

The output should be 21 as it is C (12) + H (1) + O (8) = 21.

 

We guarantee that all the inputs are valid.
